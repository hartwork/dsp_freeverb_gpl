## About

The *GPL Freeverb Winamp Plugin* (a.k.a. **dsp_freeverb_gpl**)
was my take at bringing Jeremy Wakefield's Freeverb sound effect
implementation to Winamp in 2006.  For some types of music,
it can add live/concert-like feel.  The plug-in comes with support
for presets and a simple live visualization of the waveform
before and after processing.
